# Restaurant Menu Systems - Burrito Ordering System

This repository contains my journey in developing a series of restaurant menu systems, starting with a Burrito Ordering System. This project serves as a foundational exercise in learning and applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), SOLID principles, and various C# concepts, including classes, properties, dependency injection, and methods.

## Project Overview

The Burrito Ordering System is the first in a series of restaurant menu applications that I developed to solidify my understanding of key programming concepts. This project started as a simple console application that allows users to customize and order burritos. It has since evolved into a more complex system that demonstrates principles of OOP and SOLID, making it an ideal learning platform.

## Technologies Used

- **C#**: The primary programming language used for development.
- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**: Implemented to organize the system around objects and classes.
- **SOLID Principles**: Applied to ensure the code is maintainable, scalable, and adheres to best practices.
- **Dependency Injection**: Utilized to manage dependencies and enhance testability.
- **Methods and Properties**: Employed to encapsulate logic and data, showcasing the power of reusable code.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: The system is built around objects representing different components of a burrito (e.g., tortillas, fillings, toppings), showcasing the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **SOLID Principles**:
  - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class in the system has a single responsibility, making the code easier to manage and extend.
  - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: The system is designed to allow extension without modifying existing code.
  - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Objects of derived classes can be used interchangeably with base classes without altering the correctness of the program.
  - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Interfaces are created with specific purposes, preventing the need for implementing methods that are not required.
  - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules are not dependent on low-level modules; instead, both depend on abstractions.
- **Dependency Injection**: The project utilizes dependency injection to handle dependencies between classes, promoting loose coupling and better testability.
- **Methods and Get/Set Properties**: The project leverages methods to encapsulate behavior and get/set properties to manage data access and modification.
  
## Future Directions

While this project is complete as a learning tool, it serves as a stepping stone toward more advanced applications. I plan to continue building on these concepts in future projects, integrating them with web development and more complex backend systems.
